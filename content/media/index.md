#### AST compatible
* Nothing here yet

#### RxResume
>The resumes that I build with the [Reactive Resume Builder](https:///rxresu.me).

* The full detailed(for now) resume [anas-elgarhy-resume_2023-07-12.pdf](/cv/rxresume/anas-elgarhy-resume_2023-07-12.pdf)
> I try to keep the pdf updated as much as I can. but sometimes things that aren't in our plans happen :\\, so you can see the [live version](https://rxresu.me/r/ffes5mXD) as long as the [rxresu.me](https://rxresu.me) website is UP. 

### Music
I don't make music(yet). but I have a bit strange, open-mind, closed-mind, raucous, quiet musical sense(all at the same time)

* random [traks that I just love](music/traks-i-love) and want to share it with someone.
* [My playlists](music/music-playlists)
* [OpenBSD songs](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/songs)
